Affected by this issue is the function expand of the file index.js. The manipulation leads to inefficient regular expression complexity. The attack may be launched remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. Upgrading to version 1.1.12, 2.0.2, 3.0.1 and 4.0.1 is able to address this issue. The name of the patch is `a5b98a4f30d7813266b221435e1eaaf25a1b0ac5`.

            "description": "### Summary\n\nThis affects both:\n 1. Unsupported algos (e.g. `sha3-256` / `sha3-512` / `sha512-256`)\n 2. Supported but non-normalized algos (e.g. `Sha256` / `Sha512` / `SHA1` / `sha-1` / `sha-256` / `sha-512`)\n\nAll of those work correctly in Node.js, but this polyfill silently returns highly predictable ouput\n\nUnder Node.js (only with `pbkdf2/browser` import, unlikely) / Bun (`pbkdf2` top-level import is affected), the memory is not zero-filled but is uninitialized, as `Buffer.allocUnsafe` is used\n\nUnder browsers, it just returns zero-filled buffers\n(Which is also critical, those are completely unacceptable as kdf output and ruin security)\n\n### Were you affected?\n\nThe full list of arguments that were **not** affected were literal:\n * `'md5'`\n * `'sha1'`\n * `'sha224'`\n * `'sha256'`\n * `'sha384'`\n * `'sha512'`\n * `'rmd160'`\n * `'ripemd160'`\n\nAny other arguments, e.g. representation variations of the above ones like `'SHA-1'`/`'sha-256'`/`'SHA512'` or  different algos like `'sha3-512'`/`'blake2b512'`, while supported on Node.js `crypto` module, returned predictable output on `pbkdf2` (or `crypto` browser/bundlers polyfill)\n\n---\n\nBeware of packages re-exporting this under a different signature, like (abstract):\n```js\nconst crypto = require('crypto')\nmodule.exports.deriveKey = (algo, pass, salt) => crypto.pbkdf2Sync(pass, salt, 2048, 64, algo)\n```\n\nIn this case, the resulting `deriveKey` method is also affected (to the same extent / conditions as listed here).\n\n### Environments\n\nThis affects `require('crypto')` in polyfilled mode (e.g. from `crypto-browserify`, `node-libs-browser`, `vite-plugin-node-polyfills`, `node-stdlib-browser`, etc. -- basically everything that bundles/polfyills `crypto`\n\n* In bundled code (e.g. Webpack / Vite / whatever), this affects `require('crypto')` and `require('pbkdf2')`\n* On Node.js, this does not affect `require('pbkdf2')` (or `require('crypto')` obviously), but affects `require('pbkdf2/browser')`\n* On Bun, this _does_ affect `require('pbkdf2')` _and_  `require('pbkdf2/browser')` (and returns uninitialized memory, often zeros / sparse flipped bytes)\n\n### PoC\n```js\nconst node = require('crypto')\nconst polyfill = require('pbkdf2/browser')\n\nconst algos = [\n  'sha3-512', 'sha3-256', 'SHA3-384',\n  'Sha256', 'Sha512', 'sha512-256',\n  'SHA1', 'sha-1',\n  'blake2b512',\n  'RMD160', 'RIPEMD-160', 'ripemd-160',\n]\nfor (const algo of algos) {\n  for (const { pbkdf2Sync } of [node, polyfill]) {\n    const key = pbkdf2Sync('secret', 'salt', 100000, 64, algo)\n    console.log(`${algo}: ${key.toString('hex')}`);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOutput (odd lines are Node.js, even is `pbkdf2` module / polyfill):\n```\nsha3-512:

key.toString('hex')\n  if (hex !== prev) console.log(hex);\n  prev = hex\n}\n```\n\n### Affected versions\n\nSeems to be since https://github.com/browserify/pbkdf2/commit/9699045c37a07f8319cfb8d44e2ff4252d7a7078\n\n### Impact\n\nThis is critical, browserifying code might silently generate zero-filled keys instead of proper ones, for code that was working on Node.js or in test environment\n\nJust updating to a fixed version is not enough: if anyone was using `pbkdf2` lib (e.g. via `crypto-browserify` or directly) on algos not from the literal string list (see \"were you affected\"), recheck where those keys went / how they were used,  and take action accordingly\n\n### Note\n\nMost likely, you receive this either through a subdep using `pbkdf2` module directly (and then it is used), or through `crypto-browserify` (and the usage depends on whether you or any of your subdeps were calling `pbkdf2/pbkdf2Sync` methods from Node.js crypto inside your bundle)\n\nWhen targeting non-Node.js, prever avoiding Node.js crypto polyfill at all, and use `crypto.subtle` and/or modern/audited cryptography primitives instead",

            "description": "### Summary\n\nOn historic but declared as supported Node.js versions (0.12-2.x), pbkdf2 silently disregards Uint8Array input\n\nThis only affects Node.js <3.0.0, but `pbkdf2` claims to:\n * Support Node.js [>= 0.12](https://github.com/browserify/pbkdf2/blob/v3.1.2/package.json#L62) (and there seems to be ongoing effort in this repo to maintain that)\n * Support `Uint8Array` input (input is typechecked against Uint8Array, and the error message includes e.g. \"Password must be a string, a Buffer, a typed array or a DataView\"\n\n### Details\n\nThe error is in `toBuffer` method\n\nThis vulnerability somehow even made it to tests: https://github.com/browserify/pbkdf2/commit/eb9f97a66ed83836bebc4ff563a1588248708501\nThere, `resultsOld` (where mismatch `results`) are just invalid output generated from empty password/salt instead of the supplied one\n\n### PoC\n\nOn Node.js/io.js < 3.0.0\n\n```console\n> require('pbkdf2').pbkdf2Sync(new Uint8Array([1,2,3]), new Uint8Array([1,3,4]), 1024, 32, 'sha256')\n<Buffer 21 53 cd 5b a5 f0 15 39 2f 68 e2 40 8b 21 ba ca 0e dc 7b 20 d5 45 a4 8a ea b5 95 9f f0 be bf 66>\n\n// But that's just a hash of empty data with empty password:\n> require('pbkdf2').pbkdf2Sync('', '', 1024, 32, 'sha256')\n<Buffer 21 53 cd 5b a5 f0 15 39 2f 68 e2 40 8b 21 ba ca 0e dc 7b 20 d5 45 a4 8a ea b5 95 9f f0 be bf 66>\n\n// Node.js crypto is fine even on that version:\n> require('crypto').pbkdf2Sync(new Uint8Array([1,2,3]), new Uint8Array([1,3,4]), 1024, 32, 'sha256')\n<Buffer 78 10 cc 84 b7 bb 85 cd c8 37 ca 68 da a9 4c 33 db ae c2 3d 5b d4 95 76 da 33 f9 95 ac 51 f4 45>\n\n// Empty hash from Node.js, for comparison\n> require('crypto').pbkdf2Sync('', '', 1024, 32, 'sha256')\n<Buffer 21 53 cd 5b a5 f0 15 39 2f 68 e2 40 8b 21 ba ca 0e dc 7b 20 d5 45 a4 8a ea b5 95 9f f0 be bf 66>\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nStatic hashes being outputted and used as keys/passwords can completely undermine security\nThat said, no one should be using those Node.js versions anywhere now, so I would recommend to just drop them\nThis lib should not pretend to work on those versions while outputting static data though\n\nJust updating to a fixed version is not enough: if anyone was using `pbkdf2` lib (do not confuse with Node.js `crypto.pbkdf2`) or anything depending on it with Node.js/io.js < 3.0.0, recheck where those keys went / how they were used,  and take action accordingly",

Hash state rewind on `{length: -x}`. This is behind the PoC above, also this way an attacker can turn a tagged hash in cryptographic libraries into an untagged hash.\n2. Value miscalculation, e.g. a collision is generated by `{ length: buf.length, ...buf, 0: buf[0] + 256 }`\n    This will result in the same hash as of `buf`, but can be treated by other code differently (e.g. bn.js)\n4. DoS on `{length:'1e99'}`\n5. On a subsequent system, (2) can turn into matching hashes but different numeric representations, leading to issues up to private key extraction from cryptography libraries (as nonce is often generated through a hash, and matching nonces for different values often immediately leads to private key restoration)",
